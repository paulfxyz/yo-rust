## 👨‍💻 Why this exists

I'm **Paul Fleury** — French internet entrepreneur based in Lisbon, managing infrastructure, DNS records, Docker stacks, servers, and all the operational chaos that comes with running multiple products.

And I kept hitting the same wall.

Not the hard problems — DNS propagation, TLS cert chains, Docker networking. The wall was the *boring* ones: the `find` flags I can never remember. The `rsync` syntax that doesn't accidentally wipe the destination. The `awk` one-liner to extract column 3 from a log file. The `openssl` command that decodes a certificate. Things I've typed a hundred times but never fully memorised because I don't type them every single day.

Every time: stop → open browser → search → skip ads → scan Stack Overflow → adapt → test. **Five minutes gone.** Ten times a day. An hour of archaeology.

I wanted to type `yo`, describe the thing, get the command, run it.

**No runtime dependencies.** One compiled Rust binary. One `curl | bash` to install. And now in v2.0.0 — a choice of AI backend, memory of what you just did, shell history integration, dry-run mode, and full Windows support.

> 💡 This project was designed and built in collaboration with **[Perplexity Computer](https://www.perplexity.ai)** — architecture, implementation, debugging, and documentation. A genuine example of human intent + AI execution.

## 🎬 See it in action

```
$ yo

  [banner]

  ◈  Backend: OpenRouter  model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
  ◈  Shell history: on
  ◈  Context: 5 turns

  yo ›  find all log files older than 7 days and delete them

  ◈  Finds .log files not modified in 7+ days and removes them.

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  $  find . -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -type f -delete    │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Run it? [Y/n] › Y

  ►  find . -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -type f -delete
  ✔  Done.

  Did that work? [Y/n] › Y
  ◈  Great! What else?

  yo [+1] ›  now do the same for the /tmp folder

  ◌  Thinking…

  ◈  Applies the same log cleanup to /tmp instead of the current directory.

  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  $  find /tmp -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -type f -delete       │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Run it? [Y/n] ›
```

The `[+1]` after the prompt shows how many turns of context the AI has. Follow-up pronouns and references ("same for", "now also", "undo that") work because the prior turn is passed as conversation history.

---

## 🏠 Ollama — local, private, offline

Run yo-rust against a local model with no API key and no internet:

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.2

# Start yo-rust and select Ollama during setup
yo
```

During setup, choose backend `2) Ollama`. yo-rust will ask for the URL (default `http://localhost:11434`) and model name.

Or switch at any time:
```
yo ›  use ollama
```

### Ollama model recommendations

| Model | Pull command | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `llama3.2` | `ollama pull llama3.2` | General purpose — best default |
| `mistral` | `ollama pull mistral` | Fast, good at commands and code |
| `codellama` | `ollama pull codellama` | Code-heavy sessions |
| `qwen2.5-coder` | `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder` | Programming tasks |

---

## 🧪 Dry-run mode

Preview exactly what yo-rust would do, with zero side effects:

```bash
yo --dry
```

In dry-run mode:
- The AI is called normally
- Commands are displayed in a **yellow** box with a `[dry-run]` label
- No command ever executes
- Context is still updated (follow-ups work)
- Shell history is not appended

Useful for: checking what a destructive command looks like before committing, demos, scripting around yo-rust output.

---

## 🐚 Shell detection — Windows & beyond

yo-rust detects your exact shell environment at launch and passes it to the AI as `SHELL=<kind> syntax=<family>`. The AI then generates commands in the correct syntax for your environment.

| Shell | Detected as | Syntax used |
|---|---|---|
| zsh | `SHELL=zsh syntax=posix` | POSIX + zsh idioms |
| bash | `SHELL=bash syntax=posix` | POSIX + bash idioms |
| fish | `SHELL=fish syntax=posix` | fish-compatible |
| sh / dash | `SHELL=sh syntax=posix` | Pure POSIX |
| PowerShell 5 | `SHELL=powershell5 syntax=powershell` | PS5 (no `&&`, uses `;`) |
| PowerShell 7 | `SHELL=powershell7 syntax=powershell` | PS7 (supports `&&`) |
| cmd.exe | `SHELL=cmd.exe syntax=cmd` | `&` chaining, `%VAR%` |
| Git Bash | `SHELL=gitbash syntax=posix` | POSIX via MSYS2 |

The AI knows that PowerShell 5 doesn't support `&&` (use `;` instead), that cmd.exe uses `%VARIABLE%` not `$VARIABLE`, and that Git Bash on Windows is POSIX despite being on a Windows host.

### Windows installation

> ⚠️ **Important:** On Windows, `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, which does **not** accept
> `-fsSL` flags. The Unix install command `curl -fsSL ... | bash` **will not work** in PowerShell.
> Use the options below instead.

**Option 1 — PowerShell native installer (recommended for PowerShell users):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulfxyz/yo-rust/main/install.ps1 | iex
```
Installs Rust automatically, builds yo-rust, sets up PATH and aliases. Works in PowerShell 5 and 7.

**Option 2 — Git Bash:**
Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), open Git Bash, then:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulfxyz/yo-rust/main/yo.sh | bash
```

**Option 3 — WSL2:**
```bash
# Inside a WSL2 terminal — identical to Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulfxyz/yo-rust/main/yo.sh | bash
```

### CLI flags

```bash
yo --dry          # Dry-run: show commands, never execute
yo -d             # Short form of --dry
yo --no-history   # Disable shell history appending this session
yo --no-context   # Disable multi-turn context this session
yo --help         # Show all flags
yo --version      # Show version
```

### Natural language config

```
yo ›  use ollama             → triggers !api, selects Ollama backend
yo ›  change my API key      → triggers !api, asks for new key
yo ›  switch to claude       → triggers !api, asks for model
yo ›  change backend         → triggers !api, full reconfiguration
```

## 🧠 How it works

### Reliable structured output from an LLM

The hardest problem in yo-rust is not the HTTP call — it's getting the AI to produce **machine-parseable output, every time**.

We use a strict JSON envelope:
```json
{ "commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"], "explanation": "one sentence" }
```

The system prompt states this schema twice and adds numbered rules. We also strip any accidental markdown fences before parsing. Both OpenRouter and Ollama backends go through the same parser.

### Shell detection — why it matters for Windows

Without knowing the shell, the AI must guess. A user in PowerShell 5 asking "list all processes" might get `ps aux` (Linux), which is an alias for `Get-Process` in PS but behaves completely differently. Or they might get `ls | grep nginx` which fails in PS5 because `ls` outputs objects, not text.

With `SHELL=powershell5 syntax=powershell` in the context, the AI produces `Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*nginx*"}` — correct, native PowerShell. With `SHELL=powershell7`, it can use `&&`. With `SHELL=gitbash`, it uses POSIX syntax despite being on Windows.

### Multi-turn context

Each confirmed prompt+command pair is recorded in a `ConversationContext` (rolling window, default 5 turns). On the next request, prior turns are injected as `user`/`assistant` message pairs before the current prompt. This lets the model resolve:
- Pronouns: "delete them" → refers to the files listed in the previous command
- Relative references: "now for staging" → uses the same pattern with a different path
- Negations: "without the -r flag" → modifies the previous command

The context window is bounded to prevent unbounded token growth. Oldest turns are evicted first.

### Post-execution feedback loop

After commands run, yo-rust asks "Did that work?". If not, it asks what went wrong, then constructs a refinement prompt:
```
I ran: <commands>
The problem was: <user description>
Please suggest a corrected command.
```
This is sent to the AI with the full conversation context, so the refined suggestion incorporates both the original intent and the failure mode.

### Shell history integration

Each shell has its own history format:
- **zsh**: `: <timestamp>:0;<command>` (EXTENDED_HISTORY format)
- **bash**: plain `<command>` one per line
- **fish**: `- cmd: <command>\n  when: <timestamp>` (YAML-like)

We append in the correct format for the detected shell after a confirmed execution. Writing to the file does not update the live shell's in-memory history buffer — a new terminal window (or `history -r` / `history -n`) picks up the entries.

## 🔬 Engineering notes & lessons learned

**JSON envelope beats freeform every time.** Even a `temperature=0` model will occasionally add prose around a bare command string. A JSON schema with a `commands` array and `explanation` field is parsed deterministically and has zero ambiguity.

**Shell detection is the highest-leverage Windows improvement.** The difference between `syntax=posix` and `syntax=powershell5` is the difference between getting `&&` (invalid in PS5) and `;` (works everywhere). One env var check, massive improvement in correctness.

**PowerShell 5 vs 7 actually matters.** PS7 supports `&&` for chaining. PS5 doesn't. Users of Windows PowerShell (the built-in one) hitting "unexpected token &&" are confused — detecting the version and adjusting the syntax hint eliminates this entirely.

**Multi-turn context is a sliding window problem.** We evict the oldest turn first (FIFO), not the least recently used, because chronological order matters for resolving follow-up references. The most recent turn is most relevant.

**Post-execution feedback closes the loop.** A command that exits non-zero is not always a failure (grep returns 1 for no matches). Asking "did that work?" rather than "command succeeded?" puts the user in control of what constitutes success.

**Dry-run is useful even for experts.** Before running any destructive find+delete, previewing the command in a yellow box with `[dry-run]` label builds confidence.
