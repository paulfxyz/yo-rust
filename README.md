## 句芒 — Gou Mang, the Spirit Messenger

In ancient Chinese mythology, **Gou Mang (句芒)** served as the divine messenger between the Emperor of Heaven and the mortal world. He carried intent across the boundary between realms — translating the will of heaven into action on earth.

mang.sh is named in his honour.

You type what you want in plain English. Gou Mang translates that intent into the exact shell command your machine understands. You confirm — he executes. No ceremony. No Stack Overflow. No translation tax.

The command to invoke him is `yo` — casual, direct, immediate. The way you'd ask a friend. No incantation required.

> *"Gou Mang carried messages between the Emperor of Heaven and the mortal world. Now he carries yours — between human intent and machine command."*

## 👨‍💻 Why this exists

I'm **Paul Fleury** — French internet entrepreneur based in Lisbon. I run [Openline](https://openline.ai) and manage infrastructure across multiple products: DNS, Docker stacks, reverse proxies, SSL certs, CI/CD pipelines, API integrations, cron jobs. The full sysadmin surface.

And I kept hitting the same wall — not the hard problems, but the *tedious* ones.

The `find` flags for deleting files older than 7 days. The `rsync` invocation that syncs without wiping the destination. The `awk` one-liner for column 3 of a log. The `openssl` command that decodes a cert. The `lsof` incantation to kill port 3000. Things I've done dozens of times but never fully memorised because I don't type them *every single day*.

Every time: stop → open browser → Google it → skip ads → scan Stack Overflow → adapt the 2016 answer → test it. **Five minutes gone.** Ten times a day. That's an hour of command-syntax archaeology, daily.

I wanted something that felt like messaging a developer friend who knows Linux cold. Describe the thing. Get the command. Run it.

Three constraints I set from day one:

1. **No runtime.** One compiled binary. Works on any machine, forever, without installation ceremonies.
2. **One command to install.** `curl | bash`. Even Rust installs automatically.
3. **Any AI model.** OpenRouter for cloud (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama). Ollama for offline, air-gapped, private.

Rust answered all three. This document explains why.

## 🦀 Why Rust — a serious answer

### The binary distribution argument

A Python CLI needs Python, the right version, the right packages, the right virtualenv. A Node.js tool needs Node, npm, and potentially hundreds of packages in `node_modules`. These aren't theoretical concerns — they cause real failures in production. The wrong Python version, a missing package, a broken lockfile.

A compiled Rust binary is a single self-contained executable. Copy it to any machine with the same OS and architecture — it works. No interpreter, no runtime, no dependencies. `yo` on macOS or Linux. `yo.exe` on Windows. That's it.

For a tool you want to install once and trust forever, this is non-negotiable.

### The performance argument

Rust compiles to native machine code via LLVM — the same optimisation infrastructure used by C and C++. For mang.sh, the bottleneck is always the AI network call (500ms–3s). The binary itself starts in under 10ms. No interpreter warmup, no GC pause, no JIT compilation lag. The prompt appears instantly.

### The memory safety argument

Rust's ownership system enforces memory safety at compile time, without a garbage collector. For mang.sh this matters concretely: we spawn background threads for telemetry submissions. In C++, passing data to a thread while the main thread continues is a minefield. In Rust, the compiler refuses to compile code that would create a data race. The telemetry thread's data is *moved*, not shared — enforced at compile time, not runtime.

### The type system argument

Rust's type system encodes invariants at compile time:
- `Option<T>` forces handling the "absent" case — no null pointer exceptions
- `Result<T, E>` forces handling errors — no uncaught exceptions
- Exhaustive pattern matching: add a new enum variant and the compiler tells you every match that doesn't handle it

In mang.sh, the `ShellKind` enum covers zsh, bash, fish, sh, PowerShell 5, PowerShell 7, cmd.exe, and Git Bash. Add a new shell — the compiler flags every unhandled match. In Python, that's a runtime bug shipped to users.

### The `cargo` ecosystem

`cargo` is one of the best build tools ever designed:
- `cargo check` type-checks in seconds without building
- `cargo clippy` catches logic errors and anti-patterns beyond the type checker
- `Cargo.toml` is a clean, readable manifest with exact version locking
- Cross-compilation built in

The entire mang.sh project builds with `cargo build --release`. No Makefile, no CMakeLists.txt, no Gradle.

### Rust is not just for systems programming

The misconception: Rust is for operating systems, game engines, embedded firmware. The reality: Rust is excellent for CLI tools and developer utilities. Compile times are longer than Python (improving rapidly). The learning curve is steeper. The result: a binary that ships, works everywhere, starts instantly, and cannot crash due to memory errors or type errors. For a tool that runs shell commands on your machine, that's the right trade-off.

## 🧠 Architecture — how it works

### The hardest problem: reliable structured output from an LLM

Every LLM wants to be conversational. Ask for "a shell command to list files" and you'll get prose, markdown fences, explanations, caveats. None of that is machine-parseable.

mang.sh forces the model to respond exclusively with this JSON schema:

```json
{
  "commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"],
  "explanation": "One plain-English sentence."
}
```

The system prompt states this schema twice (once in rules, once as an example) and includes numbered constraints. We also strip accidental markdown fences before parsing. Both OpenRouter and Ollama backends go through the same parser. This single design decision — structured output over freeform — is what makes every other feature possible.

### Temperature 0.2 — why not 0?

Shell commands aren't creative. Temperature 0.2 is low enough that the model picks the conventional, widely-understood command form rather than an exotic variant. It's high enough to handle natural language variation without getting stuck. Tested across GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.2 — 0.2 produces correct, safe commands in over 95% of cases.

### Context injection — why it matters

Without context, a model asked "open the downloads folder" has to guess the platform. With `OS=macos ARCH=aarch64 CWD=/Users/paul SHELL=zsh syntax=posix` prepended to every request, the model knows: use `open`, use `brew`, use `pbcopy`, use arm64 binary paths, use POSIX syntax. Four fields. Measurable improvement in correctness.

The `syntax=posix` / `syntax=powershell` / `syntax=cmd` hint is the highest-leverage addition: it explicitly tells the model which shell syntax family to use, eliminating the most common cross-platform errors. PowerShell 5 doesn't support `&&` — the model knows this and uses `;` instead.

### Multi-turn context — how "now do the same for X" works

Each confirmed prompt+command pair is injected as prior `user`/`assistant` message pairs before the new request:

```json
[
  { "role": "system",    "content": "<system prompt>" },
  { "role": "user",      "content": "find log files older than 7 days" },
  { "role": "assistant", "content": "{\"commands\": [\"find . -name '*.log' -mtime +7\"]}" },
  { "role": "user",      "content": "now do the same for /tmp" }
]
```

The window is bounded (default 5 turns, configurable) to prevent unbounded token growth. Oldest turns evicted first.

### The N = refinement design

Previously, pressing N returned you to a blank prompt. You had to retype your entire request. Now N opens an inline refinement loop: the user describes what to change, mang.sh constructs a context-aware prompt including the original request and previous suggestion, and the AI produces an adjusted command. The loop continues until Y or explicit cancel (`!skip`, blank Enter, Ctrl-D).

This transforms mang.sh from a one-shot tool into a conversational assistant that learns from your feedback without requiring you to repeat yourself.

### Shell history — native formats

Each shell expects its own history format:
- **zsh**: `: <unix_timestamp>:0;<command>` (EXTENDED_HISTORY)
- **bash**: plain `<command>` one per line
- **fish**: `- cmd: <command>\n  when: <timestamp>` (YAML-like)

We detect which format from `$SHELL`, `$ZDOTDIR`, and `$HISTFILE`. Writing to the file doesn't update the live shell's in-memory buffer — `history -r` or a new terminal window picks up the entries.

### The thread-join pattern for telemetry

Background threads are killed when the process exits. If you confirm a command and immediately type `!exit`, a naive fire-and-forget thread never completes its HTTP POST. mang.sh stores every `JoinHandle<()>` returned by `submit_background()` in a `Vec<JoinHandle<()>>`. Every exit path (Ctrl-D, Ctrl-C, `!exit`, input error) calls `h.join()` on all handles before returning. The network requests complete before the process terminates.

### Windows PowerShell — the `cargo stderr` trap

The most counterintuitive Windows bug: `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` + `2>&1` kills the build script when `cargo` writes progress to stderr — even on success. `cargo` writes *all* progress output to stderr, not stdout. Every "Compiling foo v1.0" line becomes an `ErrorRecord` that triggers the Stop preference. Fix: remove `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`, remove `2>&1`, let cargo output flow freely, check `$LASTEXITCODE` after.

---

## 🔬 Lessons learned — building mang.sh from scratch

### On LLM prompt engineering

**State your output format twice.** LLMs attenuate instructions that appeared many tokens ago. Stating the JSON schema once at the top and again in a concrete example dramatically improves compliance, especially on smaller models.

**Structured output is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** The JSON envelope is the foundation everything else depends on. Without it, command extraction is unreliable and the entire pipeline breaks. Invest in the system prompt first.

**Temperature 0.2 > temperature 0 for tool use.** Full greedy decoding (temp=0) produces too-literal, sometimes stuck outputs. 0.2 handles paraphrasing and unusual prompts without breaking format compliance.

**Context window position matters.** The most recent message gets the most attention. Important constraints (like the JSON schema) are best restated near the end of the prompt for smaller models.

**Platform context beats tool inventories.** `OS=macos SHELL=zsh syntax=posix` is more useful than telling the model "you have access to brew, apt, etc." Let the model infer the tools from the environment.

### On Rust for CLI tools

**`cargo check` is your fastest feedback loop.** Type-checks the entire project in seconds without building. Use it constantly. `cargo build --release` only when you need the binary.

**`#[serde(default)]` on every config field.** This is the key to forward-compatible config files. Every new field added to a config struct must have `#[serde(default)]` so existing configs load without error. Forgetting this breaks every existing user's installation on the next update.

**`Box<dyn Error>` early, custom errors later.** For a project of this size, `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` as a return type lets you use `?` on any error type without defining a custom enum. The right starting point. Add custom error types when you need to match on variants.

**`Stdio::inherit()` for any program that runs other CLIs.** Capturing stdout breaks interactive programs (`vim`, `htop`), buffers streaming output (`cargo build`), and disables colour in colour-aware tools (`ls`, `grep`). Inherit stdio — always.

**Store `JoinHandle`s; never detach.** A dropped `JoinHandle` detaches the thread. When the process exits, detached threads are killed. For any background work that must complete (network requests, file writes), store the handle and join at every exit point.

### On Windows support

**`curl` is not curl in PowerShell.** PowerShell has a built-in alias `curl → Invoke-WebRequest` that doesn't accept `-fsSL`. The correct idiom is `iwr -useb <url> | iex`. Document this prominently. Provide a native PowerShell installer.

**PowerShell 5 vs 7 is a real distinction.** PS5 (built into Windows) doesn't support `&&`. PS7 does. Detecting the version and adjusting the syntax hint in the AI context prevents a class of confusing errors for Windows users.

**`$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` + `2>&1` + native commands = disaster.** This triple combination kills scripts on `cargo`'s normal progress output. The fix is to drop all three: keep `$ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"`, don't redirect stderr, check `$LASTEXITCODE`.

### On telemetry and data pipelines

**Fire-and-forget is wrong for anything that must complete.** The first version detached every telemetry thread. Every entry was silently lost because the process exited faster than the HTTP POST completed. Store handles, join at exit.

**Silent error swallowing makes debugging impossible.** `Err(_) => {}` everywhere means you can't tell if entries are being sent and rejected, or never sent. Add a debug mode (`MANGDEBUG=1`) that prints payloads and responses to stderr.

**Write-only API keys are the correct security model.** A key that can only create new bins cannot read, update, or delete anything — safe to ship in the binary. The worst-case abuse: someone adds junk entries. Noise, not a breach.
