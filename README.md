## 👨‍💻 Why this exists

I'm **Paul Fleury** — a French internet entrepreneur based in Lisbon. I manage infrastructure, DNS, deployments, server configs, and all the operational chaos that comes with running multiple products simultaneously.

And I kept hitting the same wall.

Not the hard problems — DNS propagation, TLS cert chains, Docker networking. Those I can think through. The wall was the *boring* ones: the `find` command with the exact combination of flags I need. The `rsync` syntax that doesn't wipe the destination. The `awk` one-liner to pull column 3 from a log file. The `openssl` command that decodes a certificate. Things I've typed a hundred times but never memorised because I don't type them *every* day.

Every time, the same ritual: stop what I'm doing → open a browser → search "rsync exclude directory" → skip the ads → scan Stack Overflow → copy the command → adapt it → test it. **Five minutes gone.** Multiply that by ten times a day and you've lost an hour to command-syntax archaeology.

I wanted something that felt like messaging a friend who knows Linux cold. You just describe the thing. You get the command. You run it.

The key requirement: **no runtime dependency**. I've been burned enough times by Python version hell and Node.js ecosystem chaos. I wanted a single binary that installs with one command and just works, on any machine, forever. That pointed straight at Rust.

The second requirement: **free to use immediately**. I chose [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) because it gives access to free-tier models (Llama 3.3 70B is free and excellent) and paid models (GPT-4o, Claude) behind a single API key. One key, every model, no vendor lock-in.

> 💡 This project was designed and built in collaboration with **[Perplexity Computer](https://www.perplexity.ai)** — from architecture through implementation, debugging, and documentation. A genuine example of human intent meeting AI execution.

## 🚀 Install in one command

Works on macOS and Linux. Rust is installed automatically if you don't have it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulfxyz/yo-rust/main/yo.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal, then:

```
yo
```

On first launch, you'll be asked for your [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and a model. Takes 30 seconds. Free options available.

## 🔑 OpenRouter — one key, every model

yo-rust uses [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) as its AI backbone — a single API that routes to every major model provider. One key. No vendor lock-in.

Get a key (free, no credit card required for free-tier models): **[openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)**

### Model recommendations

| Model slug | Cost | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` | 🆓 Free | Getting started — excellent quality |
| `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | ~$0.15/1M tokens | Daily driver — fast and reliable |
| `openai/gpt-4o` | ~$2.50/1M tokens | Complex multi-step requests |
| `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` | ~$0.25/1M tokens | Speed-critical workflows |
| `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` | ~$3/1M tokens | Tricky, context-heavy requests |

For shell command generation at temperature 0.2, the free Llama model performs comparably to GPT-4o-mini for most tasks. Start free, upgrade if you hit limits.

## 🧠 How it works

### The problem with freeform LLM output

The hardest engineering challenge in yo-rust isn't the Rust code — it's getting the AI to produce **reliable, machine-parseable output** every single time.

Ask an LLM to "output just a shell command" and it will, with some probability, instead give you:

```
Here's how you can do that:

```bash
find . -name "*.env"
```

This command will recursively search...
```

None of that is what we need. We need the command string and nothing else.

### The solution: a strict JSON envelope

Every request to OpenRouter includes a system prompt that instructs the model to respond **only** with a JSON object matching this schema:

```json
{
  "commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"],
  "explanation": "One sentence describing what the commands do."
}
```

This works because:
- LLMs are extensively trained on JSON and reliably produce valid JSON when a schema is clearly specified
- The schema forces separation between the machine-readable part (`commands`) and the human-readable part (`explanation`)
- We can parse and validate deterministically with `serde_json`
- An array naturally handles multi-step answers without string splitting

We also strip any accidental markdown fences (` ```json `) the model might add — belt-and-suspenders parsing.

### Temperature 0.2 — why not 0?

Shell commands are not creative. You want the model to pick the highest-probability, most conventional answer — the command that any experienced sysadmin would write. Temperature 0 would be fully greedy (always the single most likely token), which can produce repetitive or stuck outputs for some models.

At `0.2`:
- The model picks the most likely command in ~95% of cases
- It has just enough randomness to handle natural language variation in prompts
- It never "gets creative" with flags or invents tool names

Empirically tested across GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3 Haiku, and Llama 3.3 70B — `0.2` gives correct, safe commands consistently.

### Context injection — matching commands to your machine

Without context, a model asked to "open the downloads folder" doesn't know if you're on macOS (should use `open ~/Downloads`), Linux (should use `xdg-open ~/Downloads`), or a headless server (neither makes sense).

yo-rust prepends every prompt with:

```
System context: OS=macos ARCH=aarch64 CWD=/Users/paul/project SHELL=/bin/zsh
```

With this, the model knows:
- Use `brew` not `apt` or `apt-get`
- Use `open` not `xdg-open`
- Use `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` for clipboard operations on macOS
- Use paths relative to the actual CWD
- Use zsh-compatible syntax when the user mentions "shell alias" or "profile"

Four fields. Massive improvement in command accuracy.

### Intent detection — no API call for config changes

When a user types "change my API key", we don't send that to the AI. We detect it locally using 8 regex patterns and immediately open the reconfiguration wizard. This is:

- **Instant**: microseconds vs 1–3 seconds for an API round-trip
- **Free**: zero tokens consumed
- **Reliable**: regex patterns are more predictable than LLM intent classification for a narrow domain

The patterns are conservative — they only match phrases that unambiguously mean "please reconfigure", not anything that could be a valid shell task.

### Command execution: `sh -c` with inherited stdio

Commands are executed via:

```rust
Command::new("sh").arg("-c").arg(cmd)
    .stdin(Stdio::inherit())
    .stdout(Stdio::inherit())
    .stderr(Stdio::inherit())
    .status()
```

**Why `sh -c` and not direct `exec`?**

LLM-generated commands use shell features that only the shell interprets:
- Pipelines: `ps aux | grep nginx | awk '{print $2}'`
- Redirections: `echo "hello" >> file.txt`
- Glob expansion: `rm *.tmp`
- Environment variables: `cd $HOME/projects`
- Command chaining: `git add . && git commit -m "fix"`

Parsing these ourselves would mean reimplementing a shell. Delegating to `sh -c` is correct, safe, and keeps the code at ~10 lines.

**Why inherited stdio?**

Using `Stdio::piped()` to capture output would break:
- **Interactive programs**: `vim`, `htop`, `less`, `fzf` need a real TTY and will either crash or show nothing with piped stdio
- **Streaming output**: `cargo build`, `npm install`, `docker pull` print progress in real time — piping buffers it until completion
- **Colour output**: `ls`, `grep --color`, `cargo` check whether stdout is a TTY and disable colour for pipes

Inherited stdio is the correct choice for a terminal assistant.

### No async runtime — a deliberate decision

yo-rust uses `reqwest::blocking` (synchronous HTTP) rather than `tokio` + `reqwest` async. Why?

yo-rust makes **one HTTP request per user prompt**, with seconds of human think-time between requests. There is nothing to parallelise. An async runtime would add:
- ~200 KB to the binary size
- ~30 seconds to compile time on a cold build
- Cognitive overhead (`async fn`, `.await`, `#[tokio::main]`)

For a single sequential HTTP call, `reqwest::blocking` is the right tool. We print "Thinking…" before the call so the user knows the program is alive during the wait.

---

## 🔬 Challenges we solved

These are the real engineering problems encountered while building yo-rust — not the obvious ones.

### 1. Getting structured JSON from LLMs, reliably

**The problem**: Models ignore format instructions unpredictably. A model that outputs perfect JSON for 50 prompts in a row will suddenly wrap it in markdown fences or prepend "Sure!" on the 51st.

**The solution**: A system prompt with numbered rules, the schema repeated twice (in the instructions and as an example), plus client-side fence stripping. We use `serde_json::Value` (generic parse) rather than deserialising directly to a typed struct, which lets us give meaningful error messages including the raw response when parsing fails.

### 2. Making config reconfiguration feel natural

**The problem**: Users naturally type things like "yo, can I change my API key?" as if talking to a person. Requiring them to know the exact `!api` shortcut feels mechanical.

**The solution**: Eight regex patterns on the lowercase prompt detect configuration intent before any API call. Caught before network I/O — the response is instant. The patterns are anchored loosely enough to catch variations ("update", "change", "new", "set") but specific enough to avoid false-positives on real shell tasks.

### 3. Interactive commands and streaming output

**The problem**: Early prototypes captured command stdout and printed it after the process exited. This broke `vim` (needs TTY), `htop` (needs TTY), `less` (needs TTY), and made `cargo build` appear to hang silently for 30 seconds then dump 200 lines of output at once.

**The solution**: Inherit stdin/stdout/stderr directly. The child process gets the same TTY file descriptors as the parent. Output streams in real time. Interactive programs work. This is a one-line change in Rust (`Stdio::inherit()`) but required understanding why the naive approach fails.

### 4. Version string in the ASCII banner

**The problem**: The ASCII banner is a grid of Unicode box-drawing characters. Embedding a version string requires careful spacing — one character off and the right border misaligns.

**The solution**: A `VERSION` constant at the top of `ui.rs` and a `format!()` call that injects it into the version line. The only manual alignment needed is on the version line itself; all other lines are static strings. Future versions: use `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` to read the version from Cargo.toml at compile time and eliminate the manual sync.

### 5. First-run UX without being annoying

**The problem**: Tools that ask 10 questions before you can use them are frustrating. But you genuinely need an API key to do anything.

**The solution**: Detect first run by checking for an empty `api_key` field (the `Default` impl produces empty strings). Ask only two things: key and model (with sensible defaults). Save immediately to disk so a crash during setup doesn't lose the key. The whole flow takes under 30 seconds and is never shown again unless the user explicitly requests it.
